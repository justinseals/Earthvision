				<h2>Maglev Trains</h2>
					<p>Maglev, or Magnetic Levitation is the process of train propulsion that, whistle currently implemented in a limited manner in some countries, is not employed to anywhere near the potential it can provide. Using magnets to elevate the train off the tracks immediately eliminates the track friction, leaving only air resistance. This allows a train to be propelled magnetically with much less energy and a smoother ride. This, of course, can be powered renewably as only electricity is needed, not fuel.</p>

				<h2>Maglev Trains - Transatlantic Tunnel</h2>
					<p>The theoretical practicalities of a vacuumed tunnel transporting 100% clean renewable energy consuming maglev trains at 5000 km/h. Such an incredibly high speed mode of transport opens up the doorway for removing heavy polluting modes of transport such as aeroplanes.</p>

				<h2>Electric Cars</h2>
					<p>Electric cars run purely on electricity (unsurprisingly), so no fossil fuels are consumed to drive one. Instead of fuel tanks they employ large batteries to hold sufficient charge for the journeys they will make, recharging through being plugged in whilst parked. Using electric motors instead of engines means the car is comparatively very quiet and has full torque from the get go (fast acceleration). Typical perceived downsides to electric vehicles are cost and range (they can't 'refuel' instantly like fossil fuel based vehicles), both of which will become less of a prominent problem in time.</p>

				<h2>Car Autopilot</h2>
					<p>Manual drivers are not required in cars, if proper integration of global mapping, positioning, and networked cars are implemented. Google is currently trialling this with modified trial cars. It has been shown to significantly reduce error in driving and, consequentially, save many lives in the process.</p>
