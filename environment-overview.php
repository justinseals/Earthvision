					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>As harsh as it sounds to hear, nature is effectively a dictator. As much as someone may want to believe they can walk up a wall, gravity won't allow it. Similarly, there are those who intend on, as an example, mining the resources we have bare, for profit, with little to no concern for the carrying capacity of the earth. Whilst this is obviously unsustainable at anywhere near the rates that we are doing this, too few realise that at a certain point, nature won't allow it, simply because the earth is finite.</p>
					<p>With this in mind, would it not be an idea to preserve what we have to the best of our technological ability and use sustainable practices to allow our children to live in a world that is not stained by pollution and disputes over dwindling resources?</p>
