					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>Technology is the means by which we reduce the need for a person to perform a repetitive or redundant task. It enables us to observe and measure things previously undetectable. It is simply the process of applying our accumulated knowledge and understanding of how the world around reacts and interacts, and using it to produce something of functional value.</p>

					<h3>Mechanisation:</h3>
					<p class="top0">The trend of mechanisation is the act of replacing a human workforce with automated machinery, whether it be in manufacturing, retail, delivery or any activity reliant on a manual repetitive task. Robots do not tire due to continual work, they consistently outperform a human in repetitive manual tasks and are not subject to human error, thus producing goods of a higher quality and output. Despite being able to relieve humans of monotonous and obsolete work, the increasing use of workforce mechanisation is often actually viewed as a bad thing in our society since it displaces people from their jobs. Those jobs are unable to be replaced easily, yet instead of trying to figure out how to adapt our system to accommodate the benefits of machine labour, we instead view mechanisation as the practice at fault.</p>
